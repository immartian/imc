Fast forward to today, and tests of the two leading theories of consciousness have revealed that both are still incomplete. The so-called &amp;ldquo;easy&amp;rdquo; problem of identifying neural correlates of consciousness proved far more complex than expected, with crucial aspects like self-awareness and subjective experience often overlooked in studies. As for the &amp;ldquo;hard&amp;rdquo; problem — how brain processes create subjective conscious experience — it remains unsolved and likely will for a long time (Costandi, 2023).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
