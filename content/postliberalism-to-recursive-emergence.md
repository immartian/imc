# Beyond Regime Change: From Postliberalism to Recursive Emergence

**A review of Patrick Deneen’s *Regime Change* and a vision for an evolving civic order**

In *Regime Change: Toward a Postliberal Future*, Patrick Deneen delivers a searing critique of the liberal order and a compelling case for its moral and political replacement. He argues that liberalism—once promising liberty, pluralism, and human dignity—has in practice hollowed out tradition, community, and the moral imagination. What remains is a technocratic elite ruling over a fragmented populace, disembedded from virtue, history, and shared meaning.

Deneen’s solution is not a return to tyranny or theocracy, but a re-founding of the regime on classical terms: **an “aristopopulism”** where morally grounded elites align with the people to restore the common good. This “regime change” is not merely electoral, but civilizational—grounded in virtue, tradition, and shared responsibility.

But even as Deneen calls for a new moral order, he leaves the mechanism of transition vague. How does a broken regime *actually* evolve—without collapse, coercion, or civil war? How do we build not just **better rulers**, but **better structures** of memory, feedback, and coherence that adapt over time?

This is where the lens of **Recursive Emergence (RE)** offers a vital complement to Deneen’s vision—a way to move not just morally, but structurally and systemically into the postliberal future.

## Liberalism’s Real Collapse: From Memory Loss to Moral Drift


Deneen is right: liberalism today is adrift. It promises openness but delivers disorientation. It celebrates individual choice but erodes the shared moral frameworks that make choice meaningful. In RE terms, liberalism suffers from several deep structural failures.

First, there is a collapse of institutional memory (Ψ↓). Institutions and communities forget their founding purpose, and the rich lessons of history are flattened into mere content. The stories and experiences that once shaped collective identity are lost, leaving people unmoored from the past and unable to draw on its wisdom.

Second, symbolic disintegration (Φ↓) has set in. Rituals and common language that once bound people together no longer carry the same weight. Words and ceremonies that previously fostered unity and meaning have become worn thin, unable to inspire or connect. The shared myths and values that gave coherence to society are eroding, replaced by fragmented narratives and fleeting trends.

Third, there is a failure of feedback (Ω mismatch). Elites govern without real correction or accountability, and the system resists adaptation. Mechanisms for listening, learning, and responding to the needs of the populace are weak or absent. As a result, the gap between rulers and the ruled widens, and the system becomes increasingly brittle and out of touch.

The result is rising entropy: contradiction, confusion, and moral exhaustion. Deneen’s instinct is to root us back into tradition—to rebuild from virtue outward. But what if tradition itself must **emerge recursively**, rather than be restored by will?

## Toward a Living Moral Order: The Recursive Approach


Recursive Emergence offers a complementary path to Deneen’s postliberal hope—one that focuses not on restoring a fixed order, but on rebuilding the conditions for meaning to re-emerge, layer by layer.

In the RE framework, a healthy society evolves through a dynamic process. People compress their experiences into memory (Ψ), distilling stories, lessons, and templates that become the foundation for collective wisdom. These memories then cohere into symbols and values (Φ), expressed through language, rituals, and shared myths that give shape and meaning to social life. Over time, these symbols are embedded into evolving institutions (Ω), forming the norms, laws, and governance structures that organize society. Crucially, the entire system must support feedback, reuse, and renewal (ΔH↓, R↑), allowing for adaptation and growth in response to changing circumstances.

Where Deneen focuses on moral elites as the agents of renewal, RE emphasizes the importance of structural feedback loops—systems that build distributed memory and coherence capable of surviving time, change, and disagreement.

## From Reaction to Emergence: Envisioning a Better Society


Rather than attempt to impose virtue from above or simply restore the past, RE envisions a civic order that grows organically from the ground up. Small patterns of trust and meaning are cultivated at the local level—through neighbor circles, school rituals, micro-cooperatives, and civic liturgies. These practices foster genuine connection and shared purpose, creating the seeds of a resilient social fabric.

As these patterns prove useful and resonant, they are shared, copied, and adapted—not through rigid ideology, but through practical relevance and emotional resonance. The process of emergence happens not through sudden revolution, but through layered reuse, much like fungi weaving a forest floor. Each new layer builds on the previous, strengthening the whole system and enabling it to adapt to new challenges.

Instead of debating “regime change” in terms of leaders, we could speak of lattice change—a shift in how institutions process memory, feedback, and contradiction. This is how systems survive entropy: by learning, evolving, and renewing themselves. It is the path by which democracies heal and civilizations find new coherence.

## A Regime That Can Evolve

In the end, *Regime Change* is a necessary diagnosis—but it risks becoming nostalgic if it does not embrace systems thinking. The world we inherit is fragmented, digitized, plural, global. No static order will hold. What we need is a **moral structure that can adapt**.

That is the promise of Recursive Emergence: not a restoration, but a rebirth—**not tradition frozen, but tradition that learns**. A regime not of steel beams, but of growing roots. One that remembers, reuses, reconciles—and remains coherent through change.

Deneen gave us the question. RE may offer the mechanism.
