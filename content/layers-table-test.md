<h2>Recursive Emergence: Nested Layers Table Demo</h2>

      <b>Chemical &amp; Biological Layer</b><br>
      Emergence began with the understanding of elemental harmony, echoing the ideas of Empedocles, and grew through Darwin's recognition that life evolves recursively through natural selection. Schrödinger reframed life as a sustained rebellion against entropy.

            <b>Neural Layer</b><br>
            The mapping of our neural architectures by Ramón y Cajal and adaptive wiring by Hebb revealed how minds can recursively model themselves and their environments.

                  <b>Cognitive Layer</b><br>
                  From Descartes's cogito to William James's stream of consciousness, Gödel's self-referential systems, and Dennett's view of consciousness as an emergent, recursive process, these threads converge to frame self-awareness as a mathematical necessity of recursive feedback.

                        <b>Cultural Layer</b><br>
                        The moral recursions of Confucius, cultural scaffolding by Vygotsky, and Dewey's pragmatism inform Sharism—networked sharing as an accelerator of cultural evolution.

                              The visions of Turing, von Neumann, and Bush transformed thought into computation and machines. This trajectory continues with platforms like Here.News and explorations into AI consciousness.

                                    If Einstein articulated the geometry of spacetime, Recursive Emergence offers a geometry of emergence—designing new recursive layers for life, mind, and society.
