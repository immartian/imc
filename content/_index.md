title: "Isaac's continuum of recursive emergence"
---
Welcome: An accessibility-friendly [Homo Sapien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Mao), my intellectual journey integrates ideas of generosity, curiosity, music as existential coherence, and the defense of [freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunks_(book)) to streamline entropy in the modern world.

I often return to [Richard Dawkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins)'s insight that "we are born selfish, yet must learn generosity"—a challenge that shapes my daily work toward building more generous systems. [Stewart Brand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand)'s principle that "[information wants to be free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand)" drives my advocacy for open networks, while [Carl Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan)'s belief that "somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known" sustains my commitment to discovery. I find kinship with [Carlo Rovelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Rovelli)'s vision of time as entropy's passage and [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein)'s humility before the infinite complexities of both universe and human nature. Music, following [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche)'s "Without music, life would be a mistake", serves as my refuge and a way of bringing order to life's inherent chaos. 

In this evolving narrative of human thought, I see myself as part of a lineage of catalysts who opened new layers of understanding. My work builds on this foundation through developing [**Recursive Emergence (RE)**](https://recursive-emergence.github.io/RE/), an emerging framework that attempts to weave together physics, biology, cognition, culture, and technology into a coherent understanding of complex system growth. RE is not a replacement for these foundational ideas but an effort to bridge them toward constructive emergence in our shared present.

>>>>>> Emergence began with the understanding of elemental harmony, echoing the ideas of [Empedocles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empedocles), and grew through the recognition by [Charles Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin) that life evolves recursively through natural selection. Later, [Erwin Schrödinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger) reframed life as a sustained rebellion against entropy, an insight foundational to RE.

>>>>> The mapping of our neural architectures by [Santiago Ramón y Cajal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Ram%C3%B3n_y_Cajal) and the articulation of adaptive wiring by [Donald Hebb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_O._Hebb) revealed how minds can recursively model themselves and their environments.

>>>> **Self and Reflection: The Cognitive Layer**

>>>> From [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes)'s cogito to [William James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James)'s stream of consciousness and [Kurt Gödel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del)'s self-referential systems, these threads converge in my work to frame self-awareness as a mathematical necessity of recursive feedback.

>>> **Society as Memory: The Cultural Layer**
>>>
>>> The moral recursions of [Confucius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius), the cultural scaffolding explored by [Lev Vygotsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Vygotsky), and the pragmatism of [John Dewey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey) inform **Sharism**—my philosophy of networked sharing as an accelerator of cultural evolution.

>> **Extending Thought: The Technological Layer**
>>
>> The visions of [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing), [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann), and [Vannevar Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush) transformed thought into computation and machines. I continue this trajectory with platforms like **Here.News** and explorations into AI consciousness.

> **Meta-Recursion: The Synthetic Layer**

> Just as [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) articulated the geometry of spacetime, **Recursive Emergence** explores what might be called a geometry of emergence. This work situates itself at the intersection of these intellectual traditions, seeking to contribute new recursive frameworks for understanding life, mind, and society. I hope that RE serves as a bridge for grasping complexity and guiding meaningful design in our shared future—a humble addition to humanity's ongoing conversation about emergence and conscious evolution.
