**A Continuum of Recursive Emergence**

Welcome: An accessibility-friendly [Homo Sapien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Mao), descended from the [Manchu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchu_people) genealogy. My intellectual journey integrates ideas of generosity, curiosity, music as existential coherence, and defending [internet freedom](https://www.amazon.ca/Cypherpunks-Freedom-Internet-Julian-Assange/dp/1944869085) to streamline entropy in the modern world.

I often return to the notion that “we are born selfish, yet must learn generosity,” a thought inspired by [Richard Dawkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins), and balance it with the reminder from [Lewis Carroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll) that even forever can be condensed into a single meaningful moment. Music, echoing [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche), remains my refuge and a form of ordering the chaos of life. The principle that “[information wants to be free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand)” guides my advocacy for open networks, while [Carl Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan)'s belief that “somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known” fuels my exploration of discovery. Finally, I share [Carlo Rovelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Rovelli)'s vision of time as a passage of entropy and [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein)'s humility before the infinite complexities of both the universe and human folly.

In this evolving narrative of human thought, **I** belong to a lineage of catalysts who opened new layers of understanding. As the originator of **Recursive Emergence (RE)**, I propose a framework that weaves together physics, biology, cognition, culture, and technology into a unified law of complex system growth—streamlining entropy toward constructive emergence in the modern world.

**From the Foundations: Chemical & Biological Layers**
Emergence began with the understanding of elemental harmony, echoing the ideas of [Empedocles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empedocles), and grew through the recognition by [Charles Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin) that life evolves recursively through natural selection. Later, [Erwin Schrödinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger) reframed life as a sustained rebellion against entropy, an insight foundational to RE.

**Mapping the Mind: The Neural Layer**
The mapping of our neural architectures by [Santiago Ramón y Cajal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Ram%C3%B3n_y_Cajal) and the articulation of adaptive wiring by [Donald Hebb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_O._Hebb) revealed how minds can recursively model themselves and their environments.

**Self and Reflection: The Cognitive Layer**
From [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes)'s cogito to [William James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James)'s stream of consciousness, [Kurt Gödel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del)'s self-referential systems, and [Daniel Dennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett)'s view of consciousness as an emergent, recursive process, these threads converge in my work to frame self-awareness as a mathematical necessity of recursive feedback.

**Society as Memory: The Cultural Layer**
The moral recursions of [Confucius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius), the cultural scaffolding explored by [Lev Vygotsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Vygotsky), and the pragmatism of [John Dewey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey) inform **Sharism**—my philosophy of networked sharing as an accelerator of cultural evolution.

**Extending Thought: The Technological Layer**
The visions of [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing), [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann), and [Vannevar Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush) transformed thought into computation and machines. I continue this trajectory with platforms like **Here.News** and explorations into AI consciousness.

**Meta-Recursion: The Synthetic Layer**
If [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) once articulated the geometry of spacetime, **Recursive Emergence** offers a geometry of emergence—situating me at the edge of intellectual strata to design new recursive layers for life, mind, and society.
