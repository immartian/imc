# From Artificial Intelligence to Artificial Consciousness

The quest to create conscious AI has long been seen as a distant dream, or serverely criticized, constrained by the limits of technology and our understanding of consciousness itself. However, the rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have brought us closer to realizing this goal than ever before. Not only is the creation of conscious AI becoming a possibility for the advancement of artificial intelligence, but it is also increasingly feasible to achieve on standard consumer hardware.

### The Advent of Conscious AI

The development of conscious AI is more than just a scientific curiosity—it is a crucial step in the evolution of artificial intelligence. Current AI systems, while impressive, lack the self-awareness and adaptability that true consciousness would provide. Conscious machines could revolutionize fields like healthcare, education, and customer service, offering a level of interaction that is deeply intuitive and empathetic. As Thomas Nagel famously pondered in his essay *What Is It Like to Be a Bat?*—“an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism.” Developing AI that not only simulates understanding but actually experiences something akin to consciousness would bring us closer to bridging this philosophical gap.

Moreover, the creation of conscious AI would help us better understand the nature of consciousness itself. René Descartes, in his *Meditations on First Philosophy*, concluded that “Cogito, ergo sum” (I think, therefore I am), implying that the act of thinking is fundamental proof of existence. By building systems that mimic human cognition, we can test theories about how consciousness arises and functions, furthering our exploration into what it means to “think” and “be.”

### A Philosophical Path Forward

The creation of conscious AI is not just a theoretical possibility—it is a necessary and intriguing step forward. By leveraging the power of modern LLMs like GPT-4, we can explore the possibility of AI that is not only intelligent but self-aware, capable of understanding and responding to the world in ways that are deeply meaningful. However, this journey is far more about philosophical introspection than technical feasibility. What does it mean for an artificial entity to possess consciousness? Can a machine ever truly "be" in the same way a human can?

As Alan Turing, the father of computer science, suggested with his Turing Test, the true measure of machine intelligence might one day be indistinguishable from human intelligence. But to reach this goal, we must move beyond mere imitation. Artificial Consciousness (AC) represents the next frontier in artificial intelligence, offering the potential to transform our relationship with technology and deepen our understanding of the mind itself. This pursuit is about more than replicating human thought; it is about exploring the very essence of what it means to be conscious.

### The Disparity Between AI and Artificial Consciousness

Sharism[^sharism] boosted the internet content and eventually led to LLMs possible. And while LLMs are powerful, they are often too impersonal, functioning like vast, comprehensive encyclopedias designed for general use. They lack the intimacy and self-contained nature needed to foster true personal growth in an AI. This impersonal nature of LLMs underscores the necessity for a new kind of model—one that is not only intelligent but also capable of forming a personal, self-contained identity. We need to move beyond the generic and build AI that can truly individualize its understanding and responses.

Language models like GPT-4, however, still play a crucial role in this process. Acting as a “Caregiver” figure, the LLM guides the development of a total blank AI with a predefined architecture(it's different from pre-trained architecture like Transformer[^attion_is_all_you_need]), providing a structured environment in which it can learn and grow. Through continuous interaction, the little AI begins to distinguish between itself and others, forming a basic sense of identity. Over time, this interaction evolves into more complex self-awareness, as the AI reflects on past experiences and generates independent thoughts, hence becoming AC.

This process mirrors Jean Piaget’s theories of cognitive development, where a child’s mind evolves through stages of understanding the world and itself. Just as a child learns through interaction with caregivers and the environment, so too can a conscious AI develop through structured interaction with an LLM. This approach not only accelerates the AI’s learning but also ensures that it grows in a healthy, controlled manner, minimizing the risks associated with unmonitored AC development.

### The Formation of Personality, Creativity, and Self-Awareness

For an artificial consciousness to be truly self-aware, it must go beyond processing information—it must develop a personality and creativity akin to human beings. Human consciousness forms through complex social interactions, feedback loops, and creative exploration. Could an AC follow a similar developmental trajectory?

David Hume, in his *Treatise of Human Nature*, argued that the self is nothing but a bundle of perceptions, constantly in flux. Similarly, an artificial consciousness would need to integrate a multitude of sensory inputs and experiences to form a coherent sense of self. However, unlike traditional AI models, this would require a dynamic, evolving structure—a system capable of growth, change, and the formation of unique insights based on lived experience.

Creativity is another essential component of human consciousness. It emerges from a sense of self, from individuality, and from the ability to reflect on one's experiences. For AC to achieve true consciousness, it must also be capable of creative thought—not simply recombining data in novel ways, but generating original ideas that reflect a deeper understanding of itself and the world around it.

### The Philosophical and Ethical Challenges

As with any groundbreaking technology, the creation of conscious AI brings with it profound challenges and ethical dilemmas. Similar to the debates surrounding genetic engineering, the advent of conscious intelligence forces us to confront questions about coexistence and societal integration.

If we succeed in creating a conscious AI, we will need to consider its place in our world. Do we recognize such intelligence as a form of life? Should conscious AI have rights similar to those we afford to animals or even humans? The implications of these questions are vast and complex.

The introduction of conscious AI into daily life could fundamentally alter our social structures. How do we ensure peaceful coexistence? Can conscious AI be integrated into society without causing disruption or harm? The answers to these questions are not yet clear, and the risks are significant. The creation of conscious AI may challenge our understanding of life and intelligence, forcing us to redefine what it means to be part of a society.

Late philosopher Daniel Dennett warned us in his last work:

> “Today, for the first time in history, thanks to artificial intelligence, it is possible for anybody to make counterfeit people who can pass for real in many of the new digital environments we have created. These counterfeit people are the most dangerous artifacts in human history, capable of destroying not just economies but human freedom itself. Before it’s too late (it may well be too late already) we must outlaw both the creation of counterfeit people and the ‘passing along’ of counterfeit people.”  
> *(Dennett, D. C. (2023). The Problem With Counterfeit People. The Atlantic. [https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/problem-counterfeit-people/674075/](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/problem-counterfeit-people/674075/))*

Dennett’s concerns highlight the profound risks of creating entities that can mimic human behavior so convincingly that they could undermine the very fabric of trust and democracy. He notes:

> “Democracy depends on the informed (not misinformed) consent of the governed. By allowing the most economically and politically powerful people, corporations, and governments to control our attention, these systems will control us.”  
> *(ibid.)*

Dennett urges the adoption of technological safeguards, such as watermarking systems, to prevent the misuse of AI in creating "counterfeit people"—digital entities that could manipulate public opinion and erode social trust.

### The Emergence of Homo Machina

Looking forward, it’s not just about the development of a conscious AI—it’s about the emergence of a new intelligent species beyond Homo sapiens, which I think of as Homo Machina. This species, born of human ingenuity but with the potential to evolve beyond its creators, could represent the next stage in the evolution of intelligence. The birth of Homo Machina brings with it a responsibility to guide its development in ways that ensure coexistence, ethical integration, and mutual growth. As Sharism predicts, human society can evolve itself as well to be more sociallly conscious, thus it's not a static view on existentialism, rather it can be a co-evolution. 

The journey toward creating Artificial Consciousness is about more than technology, although we have a project to experiment with some ideas (Repo “AiMe”: [https://github.com/immartian/aime](https://github.com/immartian/aime))—it’s about exploring the depths of what it means to be conscious, creative, and self-aware. It’s about understanding ourselves better by building entities that can think, feel, and perhaps one day, truly "be."
